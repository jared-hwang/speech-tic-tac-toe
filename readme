Our project will be Tic-Tac-Toe, using speech recognition to input game commands. Since our new
technology is speech recognition, the program needs to be able to recognize basic input commands.
The nine basic commands it needs to be able to recognize are:

  Top Left
  Top Middle
  Top Right
  Middle Left
  Middle
  Middle Right
  Bottom Left
  Bottom Middle
  Bottom Right
  
We tested these commands with our feasibility program and they all worked successfully.


To run the feasibility test, run "python3 main.py"
